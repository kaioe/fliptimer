- **🌙 Dark Theme** - Beautiful dark theme with subtle gradients and customizable background images.
- **⚡ Fast & Lightweight** - No dependencies beyond jQuery, CSS animations for smooth performance, and localStorage persistence.

## 🚀 Installation

FlipTimer is easy to set up and run locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaioe/fliptimer.git
   cd fliptimer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start BrowserSync on port 3000 (or the next available port) and open the timer in your browser.

> [!TIP]
> **Development Mode:** The dev server automatically watches for changes to your SCSS files and reloads the browser. It also provides preset synchronization to `fliptimer.json`. Dev and build scripts run Sass and `concurrently` through `node …` so they work even when `node_modules/.bin` is not on your PATH (common on Windows). Optional `@parcel/watcher-*` packages are declared so `npm install` can install the native file watcher for your OS; avoid `npm ci --omit=optional` or installs that skip optional dependencies, or Sass watch may fall back with a warning.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Basic Controls
- **Play/Pause:** Start or pause the timer with a 5-second countdown preparation.
- **Reset:** Return to the original time setting.
- **Presets:** Open the preset modal to manage timer configurations.

### Creating Presets
1. Click the **Presets** button (list icon).
2. Fill in the timer details:
   - **Name:** Custom label for your timer.
   - **Color:** Choose a color that will be applied to the clock digits.
   - **Duration:** Main countdown time (using the blue slider).
   - **Interval:** Break or interval time (using the orange slider).
   - **Rounds:** Number of repetitions (using the purple slider).
3. Click **Save timer** to add it to your presets.
4. Use the **checkmark icon** to apply a preset to the main timer.

### Timer Settings
Access advanced options by clicking the **gear icon** in the preset modal header:
- **Track Range:** Set maximum duration for sliders (10-60 minutes).
- **Sounds:** Choose preloaded sounds or upload custom audio files.
- **App Background:** Upload a custom background image.
- **Counter Size:** Adjust the clock size as a percentage of viewport.

## 🏗️ Building for Production

### Compile CSS
```bash
npm run build
```
This compiles `fliptimer.scss` to minified `fliptimer.css` (`--style=compressed`) and writes `fliptimer.css.map` for browser DevTools (the map file is gitignored; CI still ships it inside `dist/` when you run `build:dist`).

Development (`npm run dev`) compiles expanded CSS with the same source map so you can debug against the SCSS sources.

### Create Distribution Bundle
```bash
npm run build:dist
```
This creates a `dist/` folder with all files needed for static hosting:
- `index.html`
- `fliptimer.css` (minified), `fliptimer.css.map` when present, and `fliptimer.js`
- Vendored jQuery (`vendor/jquery.min.js`)
- `sounds/` directory with all audio files
- `favicon.svg` and optional `fliptimer.json`

> [!WARNING]
> The `dist/` folder is self-contained and can be deployed to any static hosting service (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.) without requiring Node.js on the server.

### Shipped `fliptimer.json` (GitHub Pages seed)

The committed `fliptimer.json` is copied into `dist/` and is the **first-run** preset document for visitors who have no preset data in `localStorage` yet. As of 2026-04-19 it is configured so the public demo behaves well out of the box:

- **`soundSource`: `preloaded`** with **`soundPreloaded`** pointing at real files under `sounds/` (so start / pause / finish are audible without uploading audio).
- **`appBackgroundFile`**: `imgs/background.webp`** (no base64 in the repo seed; user uploads still use a data URL in the browser only).

If the live site ever looks “wrong” after a deploy, try a hard refresh or clear site data for the Pages origin: older visits may have cached **`soundSource`: `upload`** or legacy background data in `localStorage` from an earlier seed.

**Background:** Older versions called `persistAppBgState` when `fliptimer.json` contained `appBackgroundDataUrl`, which copied a multi‑megabyte data URL into `localStorage` so the UI kept using base64 in CSS. Current code no longer persists that seed, and a one‑time migration removes stored backgrounds that are `data:image/…` **without** a `fileName` (uploads always set `fileName`).

```

> [!CAUTION]
> **CSS Compilation:** Always edit `fliptimer.scss`, not `fliptimer.css`. Browsers cannot compile Sass/SCSS directly. Run `npm run build` or use `npm run dev` for automatic compilation.

## 🌐 Browser Support

FlipTimer supports all modern browsers with CSS 3D transform support:
- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

The app uses progressive enhancement and falls back gracefully where advanced features are not available.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests.

### Development Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style and conventions.
- Edit SCSS files, not compiled CSS.
- Test changes in both development and production builds.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness is maintained.
- Add comments for complex logic.
